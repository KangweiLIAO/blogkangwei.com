# LeetCode 797: All Paths From Source to Target

## Problem Statement

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

## The Solution

Here's my solution using depth-first search (DFS):

```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Input is an adjacency list
        result = []
        target = len(graph) - 1
        def traverse(src, path):
            # init_input = (graph, 0, len(graph) - 1, [0], [])
            path = path + [src]
            if src == target:
                result.append(path)
                return
            for v in graph[src]:
                traverse(v, path)
        traverse(0, [])
        return result
```

## Understanding the Solution

### Key Points:

1. The input `graph` is an adjacency list where `graph[i]` contains all nodes that can be reached from node `i`
2. We use DFS to explore all possible paths from source (0) to target (n-1)
3. Since it's a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), we don't need to track visited nodes
4. The path is built incrementally as we traverse deeper

### A Common Pitfall: List Operations in Python

During my implementation, I initially made a mistake with list operations. Here's the key difference between `list.extend()` and `list.append()`:

```python
# Using append
list1 = [1, 2]
list1.append([3, 4])  # Result: [1, 2, [3, 4]]

# Using extend
list2 = [1, 2]
list2.extend([3, 4])  # Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In the context of our solution:

```python
# Wrong way (if we used extend)
path.extend([src])  # This would unpack the single number into the list

# Correct way
path = path + [src]  # Creates a new list with src appended
# OR
path.append(src)     # Directly adds src as a single element
```

## Graph Traversal vs Tree Traversal: A Deep Insight

One of the most interesting aspects of this problem is how it highlights the differences between graph and tree traversal. Here's my perspective:

### The Key Differences

1. **Structure**:

    - Trees are hierarchical with a single path between nodes
    - Graphs can have multiple paths and cycles

2. **Traversal Approaches**:
    - Trees: Simple DFS/BFS without cycle detection
    - Graphs: Need to handle potential cycles

### Node Traversal vs Path Traversal

When working with graphs, we have two distinct traversal scenarios:

1. **Node Traversal**:

    ```python
    visited = set()  # Marked in pre-order
    def traverseNodes(node):
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)  # Mark in pre-order
        # Process node
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            traverseNodes(neighbor)
    ```

2. **Path Traversal** (like in this problem):
    ```python
    onPath = set()  # Tracks current path
    def traversePaths(node):
        onPath.add(node)      # Mark in pre-order
        # Process path
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in onPath:  # Avoid cycles
                traversePaths(neighbor)
        onPath.remove(node)   # Unmark in post-order
    ```

In our solution, since we're working with a DAG, we don't need the `onPath` set, but understanding this concept is crucial for general graph problems.

## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(2^N \* N), where N is the number of nodes
    - In worst case, we might have 2^N possible paths
    - Each path can be up to length N
- Space Complexity: O(N)
    - The recursion stack can go up to depth N
    - We store paths of length N

## Key Takeaways

1. When dealing with graphs, always consider whether you need cycle detection
2. In Python, be careful with list operations (`append` vs `extend`)
3. DAGs simplify traversal as we don't need to track visited nodes
4. Path-finding problems often require different handling than simple node traversal

Remember: Graph traversal is like exploring a city with multiple routes, while tree traversal is like following a family tree - one path down, one path up!
