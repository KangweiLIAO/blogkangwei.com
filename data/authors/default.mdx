Hey there! I’m Kangwei 👋
Full Stack Engineer, Code Wizard, and Professional Coffee-to-Code Converter ☕➡️💻

With 3+ years of turning caffeine into scalable web apps and AI-powered tools, I’ve mastered the art of making computers do cool stuff (and occasionally debugging my life 🐞). My playground? Modern tech like React, Next.js, Python, and FastAPI, paired with DevOps magic (Docker, AWS, CI/CD) to keep things running smoother than a TikTok algorithm.

Why hire me? Glad you asked!

🚀 Built AI chatbots that almost understand sarcasm (thanks, NLP!) and slashed deployment errors to zero with CI/CD pipelines.

☁️ Saved teams 60% setup time by Dockerizing environments—because nobody likes “works on my machine” drama.

🛠️ Taught 30+ students WebGL/Three.js—because even code needs a little ✨razzle-dazzle✨.

🤑 Once made a tea shop’s checkout 50% faster with real-time order tracking (and yes, free boba was involved).

P.S. My GPA is 9/10, but my ability to over-engineer weekend projects is a solid 11/10.

Let’s build something ridiculously awesome 💥
